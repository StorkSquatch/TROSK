# TROSK
My developing OS in Rust. Right now, I am building the kernel according to Philipp Oppermann'd guide, but I am going to add my own features very soon

The name, TROSK, is due to the fact that it is a **T**est **R**ust **O**perating **S**ystem **K**ernel(it's also an anagram of Stork)

I began this around the beginning of this year. It is very rudimentary as of now and can only really display text, but I am going to be actively working on it to ensure that due passion is put into its construction.
